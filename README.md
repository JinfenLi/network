# network

*Chatroom for users*
## Background
> This research is about promoting fairness in a network, which is measured by diversity. We design an algorithm to simulate the network of board of directors. We transform such network into an undirected bipartite graph, where two sets of nodes represent directors and boards, and the connections between them are established if a director serves in a board.


## How to Run
> first run generate_data.py to dump Boardex or Boards and Gender data. You can also use the function of dump_synthetic_data to generate the synthetic network.
> Then you could either run analysis.py to get familiar with the Boardex data, or run build_network to start simulating the Boardex/Boards and Gender network.
